## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

<!-- Inform the name of the existing tool that was executed and how it was executed -->
The repository is using *react-scripts* which is internally calling **Jest** for reporting coverage and test results. We can execute it the following way:
```batch
npm run test -- --coverage
```

<Show the coverage results provided by the existing tool with a screenshot>

### Your own coverage tool

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

#### Christian Ledgard

`selectKeyValuesDataSource` & `rolesReducer`

<!-- Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the instrumented code to gather coverage measurements -->

<!-- <State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved> -->

We improve the coverage from 0% to 100% in the `selectKeyValuesDataSource` and from 66.66% to 100% in the `rolesReducer` function. The different branches were analyzed and we were able to add new tests to coverage missing paths.

<!-- <Provide the same kind of information provided for Test 1> -->

### Overall

<!-- <Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)> -->

<!-- <Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results by running the existing tool using all test modifications made by the group> -->
